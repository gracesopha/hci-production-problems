## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results).

From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your
teams’s interface from Project Two**.

Finally, I highly encourage you to work on this Production Problem with your team for Project
Two/Three to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist, and smooth the way forward
for your first (and second) round of usability testing.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. https://en.ryte.com/magazine/usability-checklist-for-successful-websites
2. https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles/wcag2-checklist/developers

* Your team’s condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. Understandable navigation points
2. Unique headings and labels
3. Have you arranged information properly? Make it easy for users to find what they’re looking for by grouping related information together.
4. Limit font styles to 2 or 3 maximum per site. Over-designing the site can be distracting.
5. Users usually expect that your site’s main logo will link to your homepage, so make sure you’ve done this.
6. Site Load-time Is Reasonable
7. Minimizing users’ input you will gain more accurate data. Don’t ask for things that are not necessary.
8. Does your site render correctly on different devices? Use responsive design and your website will render correctly to all visitors.
9. Company logo brings you to the home homepage
10. Use customer-focused language that explains the unique benefits of your products and services.
