## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=12w0u0kkthPbZqOgKlOoEdKu08Y
Your Rationale: I chose to create a monochromatic palette that was shades of green. Color theory defines green to be a representation of renewal and growth, and I feel that is fitting for games since you play different scenarios and improve your skills. Also, this palette reminded me of X-Box, so I wanted to make a tribute to that.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=50L0Z0ktJpEa7sQllr6Dam1RlhL
Your Rationale: I wanted to incorporate green and yellow for sure since spring signifies a time of regrowth. Chartreuse/green represents the beginning and growth of the new season. The burnt yellow ties in nicely since the green shade is made of lots of yellow and blue. It also brings warmness, passion, and energy, which is fitting for a garden. The last color is a red/magenta tone, which adds to the warm tones. I find it fitting since the color of flowers usually stands out against green foliage.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=3000X0kporF6RuHgHttvNo4Lqks
Your Rationale: As a kid, I always remembered seeing the primary colors on everything. I wanted to bring the blue, yellow and red to be reminded of that. Also since RYB is the foundation of all colors, I figured it would be good for kids to get exposure to that. Blue is the only cool color in this palette and represents responsibility, strength and calmness.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=1010X0kfuOp00++4IYGosCrCzxA
Your Rationale: Cybersecurity makes me think of the color red because I associate it with danger. I wanted to do another monochrome palette to show that. Since it is for a course, I chose some strong reds with high brightness to grab the reader's attention. It is a powerful color that has many meanings such as wealth, luck and anger.
